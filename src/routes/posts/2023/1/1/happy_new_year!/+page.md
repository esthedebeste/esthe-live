# happy new year!

first post of 2023 :)

honestly im really happy with 2022, did a lot of stuff, great year :)

## nerd stuff

_[skip past](#non-nerd-stuff)_

#### unintentionally long c++ rant

i learned a LOT of stuff in 2022. largely within like low-level development which like. c++ was a BIG part of that. i started really liking c++ but like. i've been so disappointed constantly because new c++ specs (especially modules) take SO long for compiler implementations to come along. in july of 2021 i started learning c++, i made some notes about modules because i preferred them over `#include`, modules are STILL weird and difficult to figure out ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­  
like honestly c++ was the biggest part of what i did this year. maybe svelte coding beats it? by a little bit? but i think c++ leads. with [fylang](https://github.com/tbhmens/fylang) <small>(my own programming language <small>(which honestly i might be dropping but ehhh we'll find out)</small>)</small>, [advent of code](https://github.com/tbhmens/advent-of-code), and a bunch of other small personal projects, c++ has been a recurring evil in my life (best compiled language still tho imo :p) and i've been loving like. actually working with native api's and stuff. however frustrating they are, it's nice that you can just kinda access everything the OS has to offer without needing to install stuff (`#include <Windows.h>` goes a long way)

my main problem with c++ rn is that like. it feels like a language i have to work around a lot of the time? like the language on it's own is just kinda in a difficult to use state. though i truly believe future specs could very much improve that (stay positive! ;p), c++ has a very bad scene for libraries right now. you either install one singular version system-wide or you compile them all in your cmake script (which is never documented by library developers because like. who even does that?)

woahhh this turned into a c++ post. woahhh. i'm not even done with the cpp rant. just gonna leave it here for now lmao

#### svelte! front-end stuff and svelte!

i've been really loving svelte and sveltekit being fully out now is really nice lmao, making my own router for wurdle and my old site was really annoying and that it's just file-system integrated makes it really simple. i also realized that, especially in the case of wurdle, the +layout.svelte file is really convenient. (one benefit of my custom router was that it had a bunch of meta tags integrated, but i'm willing to give that up for some simplicity)

i think i'm going to do some more web development this year. and i really hope it's gonna be in svelte because react is just kinda... why add jsx syntax and then not add anything more. like why stop there yk? that's what i like about svelte it's bold with adding syntax for things.

## non-nerd stuff

ok less nerdy stuff now.

#### my music taste has evolved

(tho tbh most of the year i listened to billie eilish,, can't blame me tho best music ever fr) <br/>
honestly a lot of my music phases were good. we don't talk abt age 13 but like aside from that. they were all great.
i think i've just like. grown up a lot. i'm currently listening to all of my liked songs on spotify on shuffle
and i feel like i've like bounced around a lot but i keep like rotating back?? all one big cycle. anyways.

#### im 16 now???? wtf????

another thing i've noticed. i have just like evolved as a person?? like fully? one of the craziest things i've noticed is like. wtf im aging n stuff.
like im actually getting older yk?? which is one of the biggest things that came with being 16, i feel less and less like a teenager??
like. also im 2 years away from being out of de middelbare school <sub><sup>(lmaooooo)</sup></sub>. like thats wild???? wdym im that close to university????
am i ready for all that?? idk. im excited tho. computer science has always been my thing and i hope (and believe) that
that won't change at all in university lmaooo. (no WAY i stop being a nerd)

#### streaming stuff

i kinda wanna start doing some twitch streaming in 2023 :) i'm thinking like valorant or MAYBE a coding stream (or a just chatting idk) but like. one of the most important parts for me is i wanna stream like with someone lmaoo i cannot do the whole. talk to a void thing ðŸ˜­ im great at bouncing back and forth w someone so like. idk team dynamic, !

## ok cya
